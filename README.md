# Calculator (CodSoft)

This scientific calculator built using Python and Tkinter provides a comprehensive set of mathematical functions suitable for both standard and scientific calculations. Here's a brief overview of its features:

1)User Interface: The calculator has a modern and organized layout with buttons arranged in a grid format. It uses a consistent color scheme (#2c3e50 for the background) to enhance readability.

2)Functionality:
#Basic Operations: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and decimal point (.) are supported.
Scientific Functions: Includes square root (√), pi (π), Euler's number (e), exponentiation (Exp), factorial (x!), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh), logarithms (ln, log10, log2), powers (x^2, x^3, 10^x), absolute value (|x|), and reciprocal (1/x).
Degree and Radian Conversion: Switch between degrees (Deg) and radians (Rad) for trigonometric calculations.
#Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully and displays "Error" when invalid operations are attempted.
#Clearing and Resetting: Clear Entry (CE) button resets the input field.

3)Execution: The calculator dynamically updates the display as the user enters numbers and performs calculations, ensuring smooth interaction.

4)Extensibility: The code can be extended to include additional functions or customize the user interface further, making it adaptable to specific needs.

Overall, this calculator provides a robust tool for performing both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific calculations, catering to a wide range of mathematical needs.
